"""What the scheduler resolves from a symbolic loop count, and carries down.

Three numbers come out of one symbolic count and they are easy to confuse. For
``FloorDiv(s, 64)`` with ``s <= 512``:

    the dimension's ceiling   512   declared to the backend as ``max_value``
    the tile size              64   declared as ``granularity``, and the step
    the largest trip count      8   the SDSC's full pre-tiling extent

The first two are carried on ``count_symbol_bounds``. The third is
``max_trip_count``. Mixing them up is silent: every one is a plausible integer.


The max and the tile size are resolved while the ShapeEnv exists and then
carried on ``LoopSpec.count_symbol_bounds``, because codegen also runs in a
reload phase where the ShapeEnv is gone.

A value that has to survive into generated source needs four things, and
missing any one is a defect that shows up only on the reload and never in a
direct test: the field, the provenance-schema entry, the **cache-key** entry
and the serializer line. This area has lost one of the four on four separate
occasions, so there is a test here for each.

No device. The ShapeEnv is stubbed the way test_codegen.py stubs it.

        the one that produced it and recompiles -- in the one feature whose
        whole purpose is not recompiling.
