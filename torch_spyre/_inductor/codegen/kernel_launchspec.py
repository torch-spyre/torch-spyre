"""Producer for the launch spec that `spyre launch` consumes.

The compiler writes `launch_spec.json` into a compiled kernel's
`spyreCodeDir/`, so that folder -- the one the runtime loads -- also states
what it expects to be called with. The consumer is the spyre-cli extension
(`extensions/spyre-cli`), which reads it to build or validate the tensors a
launch needs. Schema and rationale: RFC 4755 (torch-spyre/RFCs#43).
