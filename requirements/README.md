# Requirement files

These requirements files are autogenerated from the [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml) for convenience.
They are used for managing caches in CI and for the convenience of users.

- [lint.txt](lint.txt): requirements for linter checks defined in pre-commit checks
- [test.txt](test.txt): requirements for torch-spyre unit and e2e tests
- [dev.txt](dev.txt): includes lint, test requirements as well as other dev requirements for code generation

To refresh the requirement files, please run the [update.sh](../tools/update-requirements.sh) script from this folder (requires `uv`).

One of the pre-commit checks verifies if the requirement files are up to date, using the [check.sh](../tools/check-requirements.sh) script.

When it fails, it could be due to a change in the PR or to a new patch version of a library being available.
The check script will show the diff. If the version change is not related to this PR and you prefer to skip the
update for now, please pin the full package version (including patch version) in [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml).
