# Requirement files

These requirements files are autogenerated from the [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml) for convenience.
They are used for managing caches in CI and for the convenience of users.

- [dev.txt](dev.txt): everything required to lint, build, run, and test
- [build.txt](test.txt): everything required to lint, build, and run
- [lint.txt](lint.txt): everything required to lint
- [run.txt](run.txt): everything required to run

A number of tests require `torch_sendnn` to be installed. This install step is not covered by the requirements files.

To refresh the requirement files, please run the [update.sh](../tools/update-requirements.sh) script from this folder (requires `uv`).

One of the pre-commit checks verifies if the requirement files are up to date, using the [check.sh](../tools/check-requirements.sh) script.

When it fails, it could be due to a change in the PR or to a new patch version of a library being available.
The check script will show the diff. If the version change is not related to this PR and you prefer to skip the
update for now, please pin the full package version (including patch version) in [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml).
